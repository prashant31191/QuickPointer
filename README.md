QuickPointer is an application package written in Java which simulates a laser point on the screen of your computer and controlled by your android device via wireless channels.

The basic mechanism behind is that it tracks the azimuth angle and pitch angle of your mobile, then signal the computer to draw a colored point at the corresponding position of the screen.

The package consists of a Java applet and a Android application.

Due to the bluetooth libaray problem, the Java applet support only 32 bit at the moment.

This project is in heavy development, it's not prepared for public release...
There are only source codes now.
I will keep updating week by week.

A computer with the following setting:
1. A screen (of coz)
2. Java Runtime Environment 32 bit (JRE)
3. Network interface or Bluetooth

A android device with tht following setting:
1. Android 3.0 or above
